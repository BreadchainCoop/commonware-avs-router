# AVS Keys Directory
# This directory contains cryptographic keys and deployment configurations

## Structure:
```
avs-keys/
├── avs_deploy.json          # Contract deployment configuration (auto-generated)
└── operator_keys/           # BLS private keys for operators
    ├── testacc1.private.bls.key.json
    ├── testacc2.private.bls.key.json
    └── testacc3.private.bls.key.json
```

## Notes:
- All files in this directory are automatically generated by the eigenlayer service
- The avs_deploy.json contains contract addresses and deployment information
- BLS key files contain the private keys for the three test operators
- These files are shared between the router and node services via volume mounts
- In production, these keys should be managed securely and not stored in plain text

## Security Warning:
The keys generated are for LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY. Do not use these keys or
this configuration in production environments.
